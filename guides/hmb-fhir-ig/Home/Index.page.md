### Introduction
This FHIR implementation guide is part of the [Women for FHIR initiative](https://simplifier.net/organization/women-for-fhir) and focuses on improving digital support for the care pathway of Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (HMB)—a key use case highlighting the broader need for inclusive health data standards.

It provides FHIR-based resources such as Questionnaires, ValueSets, and examples to support awareness, self-assessment, documentation, and clinical workflows related to HMB.

Developed as part of the session **Let’s Build! Bridging the Gender Data Gap in FHIR** at [FHIR DevDays 2025](https://www.devdays.com/program-2025/), this guide is created through collaboration between implementers, clinicians, researchers, and advocates. It provides a starting point and serves as a foundation for further work on gender-inclusive digital health standards.

### Clinical Background

#### What is Heavy Menstrual Bleeding?

**H**eavy **M**enstrual **B**leeding (HMB) is a common but often overlooked condition characterized by excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with a woman’s physical, emotional, and social quality of life. It can signal underlying health issues and frequently goes undiagnosed or untreated.    

Recognizing and effectively documenting HMB in healthcare systems is a vital step toward better outcomes for those affected.
